# React Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe browser game. This is my first React practice project, I wrote 2 posts about [my understanding of the code](https://ming-yong.github.io/archive/2019/11/02/react-tic-tac-toe/) and [how I implemented all the additional features](https://ming-yong.github.io/archive/2019/11/23/react-tic-tac-toe-remaining-features/).
